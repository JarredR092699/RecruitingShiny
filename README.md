# RecruitingShiny
This repository includes code for how I created the cfb recruiting shiny app in R. 

This shiny app contains college football recruiting data and aims to plot the hometown latitude and longitude of every player who committed to play Division 1 football between 2000-2024.

**Example**:

Utilize the filters on the left hand side to get a better look at certain schools. In the example below we are filtering for the year 2024 and only plotting recruits who committed to Penn State.
